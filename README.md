# Discord Roles Bot! 🤖
The functionality of this Discord Bot script is to offer the ability to assign roles within a server if the name of the user is inside an excel spreadsheet.

Firstly, you will need to create the bot. Go to the following link for quick steps --> [Configuring and setting up a discord bot](https://discord.com/developers/docs/getting-started#configuring-a-bot)

Install both the *discord* and *pandas* libraries. You can open your terminal and run these commands:

    pip install discord
    pip install pandas

Once we have created the bot with the right permissions and installed the libraries, all there's left is to deploy the bot inside the server and edit the **config.py** file with the right values.

Copy and paste your bot's token inside the **config.py** file and change everything else accordingly.

Run your script and enjoy! 😄
