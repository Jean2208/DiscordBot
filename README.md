# Discord Roles Bot! 🤖
The functionality of this Discord Bot script is to offer the ability to assign roles within a server if the name of the user is inside an excel spreadsheet.

Firstly, you will need to create the bot. Go to the following link for quick steps --> [Configuring and setting up a discord bot](https://discord.com/developers/docs/getting-started#configuring-a-bot).

Once we have created the bot with the right permission and it has been deployed inside the server, all there's left is to edit the **config.py** file with the right values.

Copy and paste your bot's token inside the **config.py** file and change everything else accordingly.

Run your script and enjoy! 😄
